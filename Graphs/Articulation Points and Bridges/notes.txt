DFS Tree -> Undirected|-> Articulation Points 
					  |-> Bridges
					   
These are the properties of graphs and not the DFS tree.

DFS_num[x] --> First Time this node got visited
in_time[x]



lo_time[x] --> In the subtree, smallest DFS_num reachable  using|-> Forward Edges
low_time[x]													    |-> Backward Edges			

if v is the parent of x => lotime(x) >= intime(v) => v is the articulation point provided v is not the root & x will become a new component

v - x is a bridge iff lotime[x] > intime[v]
