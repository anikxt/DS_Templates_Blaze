/* Self notes:
- Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution per given the constraints.
- Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution, either maximum or minimum.
- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but to find ALL the solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.
